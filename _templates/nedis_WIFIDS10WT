### Flashing

I successfully flashed this device using both Tuya Convert snd serial flashing soldering cables directly onto the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) chip. I would recommend the serial flashing method which also allows you to configure the setup without worrying about the chip going to sleep.

If configuring using the battery, 3 presses within 2 seconds energise the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) for about 50 seconds.

After initial setup type the following into the Tasmota console window:

```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#data=55AA000000010101 DO POWER ON ENDON
```

Enable the rule: `Rule1 1`

Enable `SetOption66 1`

Enable `TuyaMCU 51,51`

This device on Tasmota 8.2 does not report a full TuyaMCU message, but it sends `55AA000000010101` when smoke is detected.

I am powering this device using a PoE connection linked to a DC-DC step down PCB which fits nicely in place of the 2xAA batteries. I have soldered a cable between the power and the VCC of the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) which keep the Tasmote interface permanently available and allows simple resetting of the smoke detector after an activation.
